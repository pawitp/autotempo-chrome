# AutoTempo Chrome

AutoTempo Chrome is a Chrome App to download appointments from Exchange and log them onto Tempo.
Despite its name, there is no automatic functionality at the moment and users must manually
choose the task to log them onto. Think of it as a helper tool rather than a batch process.

This project is a port of <https://github.com/dst-hackathon/autotempo/>.
